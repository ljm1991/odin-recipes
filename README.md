# odin-recipes

This is my very first project completed while working my way through The Odin Project. The assignment was to create a page with links to three different recipes utilizing the content learned in previous sections. Over the past week, I've learned how to manipulate text, use image and anchor elements, and how to create ordered and unordered lists. 

I tried my best to include a demonstration of everything I've learned. While the assignment did not call for it, I tried to add bold or italic inline text, use absolute in addition to relative links, and add an image format other than a jpeg. I also tried to take an inventory of my learning and I'll admit I was about 10-15% reliant on my notes for this. I needed a refresher mainly for the format of anchor and image elements.

This project also helped me get more comfortable with git and using the terminal. I used terminal to create my directories and files using commands like mkdir, cd, touch, code, and open. Commit messages were hard to grasp at first but after having to upload them I understand them better now. I tried to abide by the tips given by The Odin Project, though I did include a period in one of my commit messages. In the future, more commit messages would have been better and I will keep this in mind for future projects.

Overall I'm excited about all that I've learned so far, feeling much more confident about html, and am looking forward to the next lessons.
