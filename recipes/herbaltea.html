       <h2>Description</h2>
   </p>
   <p>
        This DIY tea blend is gentle yet powerful. Be aware that it is not a quick fix.
        It is designed to fortify your body over time with vitamins and nutrients to change 
        the way you feel physically and emotionally. 
   </p>
   <p> The tea is made of four herbs and one secret ingredient:</p>
   <p>
       <h3>The Herbs</h3>
   </p>
   <p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Linden</strong> has been used to ease colds and infection. Linden ontains mucilages 
               that create a protective coating that helps reduce the irriation of a dry cough.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Thyme</strong> contains essential oils that may ease a dry cough. It is packed with 
            vitamin C and A to help strengthen the immune system.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calendula</strong> is known to relieve inflammation and gain ground over lingering
                infections.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Marjoram</strong> has been used to ease colds, dry, coughs, and swollen noses 
            for centuries, though there's not a lot of clinical evidence for why or how this works.
            </li>
       </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
        <h3>The Secret</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>An Onion!</strong> I know what you're thinking but yes, an onion. Besides its use for cooking, onion
        possesses strong anti-inflammatory properities that help ease infections. It also contains vitamins 
        A, B2, C, and valuable minerals such as iron, potassium, and calcium. 
    </p>
        <p>
            Onion in tea alleviates nasal congestion, eases breathing due to congestion in the chest, reduces
            fever, and eases the pain of a cough.
